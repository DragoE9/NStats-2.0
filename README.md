# NStats-2.0
API tool for gathering N-Day Stats

Have a list of your puppets (1 per line) in a txt file called "puppets_list.txt" in the directory (same format as Cat Nuke Thing, just copy+paste it over)

Run the script by double clicking or from the command line using ``python n-stats.py``

Report any encountered bugs to DragoE or via GitHub Issues.
